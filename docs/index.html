<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    For this project, we built Bezier curves and surfaces and manipulated and changed triangle meshes. We went from being able to model curves in 2D to meshes in 3D, and being able to manipulate those curves and surfaces.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau's algorithm works by recursively dividing a given Bezier curve into smaller segments
    until the desired level of precision is achieved. The basic idea is to calculate points along the curve by
    interpolating between the control points that define the curve.<br><br>

    Implementation steps: <br><br>
    1. Start with the initial control points that define the Bezier curve. <br><br>
    2. For each level of recursion, calculate new control points by taking a weighted average of adjacent control points
    with parameter <em>t</em> : (1-t) * p_i + t * p_{i+1}. <br>
    Repeat step 2 until the desired level of precision is achieved. <br><br>
    3. The final point on the curve can be obtained by taking the last calculated control point.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by recursively subdividing the control mesh of the surface into smaller
    patches, and then using de Casteljau's algorithm to evaluate each patch. <br><br>

    Implementation steps: <br><br>

    1. Given the initial control mesh that defines the Bezier surface, divided the mesh into smaller patches using a specified level of recursion.<br><br>

    2. At each level of recursion, use de Casteljau's algorithm to evaluate the control points of each patch.<br><br>

    3. Repeat step 2 until the desired level of precision was achieved, and then used the last calculated control point of each patch to obtain the final point on the surface. <br><br>

    Finally, plot the points obtained using the algorithm to visualize the Bezier surface.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    Given the halfedge constant within the Vertex class, we need to find the area and the normal of the face and weight base on
    its area. Since we don't want to iterate through the boundary, we first check that the face is not a boundary. If it is not,
    we want to get the position of the 3 vertices using h->next()->vertex()->position and h->next()->next()->vertex()->position.
    Using these, the norm of the cross product of the two edges gives the area of the parallelogram, so the triangle's area is half
    that. We multiply the weighted normal vector by this area to weight the normal. Iterate through all the faces incident to the vertex
    and repeat this process. At the end, we normalize the weighted vector.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    For the edge flip operation, we need to first define all necessary components: the inner and outer half-edges, the vertices, the faces, and the edges.
    These components can be defined by traversing the mesh starting from e0, using next(), twin(), vertex(), surface(), and edge().
    Then, we recreate the surface of the mesh by reconnecting edges after the flipped edge.
    We use setNeighbors() to update the half-edges after the edge has been flipped. We update the corresponding half-edge of each vertex, edge, and face as well.
    For debugging, we used the teapot and flipped edges to test our code out, so that we can visualize what the newly defined half-edges are.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    The structure of the edge split operation is very similar to the edge flip operation. First, we defined all necessary components through traversing the mesh from e0, similar to part 4: the inner and outer half-edges, the vertices, the faces, and the edges.
    Then, we create a new vertex, two new triangles, and three new edges (technically there are 4 total edges in the diamond, but we only need 3 new edges as we can shrink the original in half).
    We update the pointers to the correct element in the modified mesh, setting the half-edge pointer for each vertex, edge, and face; and setting the next, twin, vertex, edge, and face pointer for each half-edge. Then, we removed the unnecessary pointer assignments once it is working.

<b>

</b>
<p>
    YOUR RESPONSE GOES HERE
    We followed the breakdown in the comments. First, we computed new positions for all the vertices in the input mesh. We computed a weighting for each vertice using the loop subdivision rule presented in lecture:
    (1 - n*u)*current position + u * weighted average of all neighboring vertices, where n is the degree of the vertex, and u is a weighting factor.
    Then, we computed the updated vertex positions associated with edges, using the formula 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D) given in the spec.
    Then, we split every edge in the mesh, making sure that we are only iterating through the original edges by storing all the original edges in a vector beforehand. We traverse all the newly created edges connected to the new point
    created by the edge split, and mark whether it is a new or old edge. We then iterate through all edges and flip any new edge that connects an old and new vertex.
    Finally, we copy the new vertex positions into final vertex position.
